# üîç PowerShell Application Discovery Script

This PowerShell script is designed to help technology owners in your organization discover the presence and details of installed applications across company workstations. It reads from a centralized configuration file, performs local discovery using file system and registry data, and logs structured output for ingestion by platforms like **Splunk**.

---

## üìÅ File Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discover.ps1                # Main PowerShell app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tech_config.json            # Config file with apps, paths, registry entries
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs\
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ discovery_YYYYMMDD.log  # Log file for Splunk ingestion
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Reads from** `tech_config.json` for:
   - App name
   - One or more installation path candidates
   - One or more registry key paths

2. **Scans local machine** for:
   - Installed EXEs
   - Registry entries in both `HKLM` and `HKCU`

3. **Logs structured discovery results** to:
   - `logs/discovery_YYYYMMDD.log` (JSON format, Splunk-ready)
   - `logs/error_YYYYMMDD.log` (errors captured per app/path with context)

## üß™ Sample Entry (discovery log)

```json
{
  "Timestamp": "2025-04-14T12:17:43",
  "ComputerName": "ACME-WS-1011",
  "UserName": "bwilson",
  "AppName": "NotePad++",
  "InstallPaths": "C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\Notepad++.exe",
  "RegistryPaths": "",
  "LastAccessed": "2025-04-12T14:55:03",
  "ExeVersions": "C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\Notepad++.exe: 8.6.3",
  "Found": true
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Edit `tech_config.json` to define the applications you want to track. Here's a sample:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "AppName": "Mozilla Firefox",
            "InstallPaths": [
            "C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe",
            "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe"
            ],
            "RegistryPaths": [
            "HKLM:\\Software\\Mozilla\\Mozilla Firefox",
            "HKLM:\\Software\\WOW6432Node\\Mozilla\\Mozilla Firefox",
            "HKCU:\\Software\\Mozilla\\Mozilla Firefox"
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```
2. Run the Script `.\discover.ps1`.
   - Optionally, you can provide a config path or log directory:
     ```powershell
     .\discover.ps1 -ConfigFile ".\my_config.json" -LogDir "C:\MyLogs"
     ```

## üßØ Error Logging

All errors are logged to logs/error_YYYYMMDD.log with:
- Timestamp
- Context of error (which app/path)
- Error message
- Stack trace (if available)

---

## ‚úÖ Output Formats

All logs are written in JSON for easy Splunk/Logstash ingestion

Fields include:
- AppName
- InstallPaths
- RegistryPaths
- ExeVersions
- LastAccessed
- Found (boolean)

---

## üîí Notes

- File LastAccessed may not always be available (depends on NTFS config)
- Registry access may require elevated permissions
- Version detection works for EXEs with standard version metadata

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- Scan all user profiles' HKCU registry
- Extract ProductName, CompanyName from EXEs
- Upload logs to central share or API
- Email alerts on certain findings
